Project : Classification of Agricultural Crop Images
Project Description: In this project, I will develop an image classification model to distinguish between 
five types of agricultural crops: wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, and jute. The dataset includes over 40 images of each crop, with an augmented set containing more than 159 images per class thanks to operations such as horizontal flipping, rotation, horizontal and vertical shifting then trying out different ML models to achieve the best prediction accuracy.
